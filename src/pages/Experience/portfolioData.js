                This is a project we developed in a UPV class in collaboration with two other classmates.
                In this project we use a kinect camera to guide a robot
                (a little car) towards a destination without any sensor integrated in the robot.
                A color cased tracking is used to distinguish between robot and destination in the camera.
                Moreover, the kinect camera allows us to guide the robot in a straight line towards the destination
                without placing the camera perpendicular to the ground due to its depth sensor.
                The project consists then of a Kinect camera connected to a computer. This computer is
                running a Matlab code that sends the moving instructions to the robot's microcontroller,
                which drives the robot's motors acording to that instructions.
                The Matlab code is integrated with a GUI that allows you to select the colors to track the
                robot and the destination.
                <br /><br />
                The color tracking functions were developed from scratch using Matlab's computer vision
                library. At that time the public color tracking methods just worked with pure
                red, green and blue because they just decomposed the image RGB matrix. My code works
                with any color and adapts constantly so it can deal with small light changes. A

                Raspberry Pi alarm clock that wakes you up in an irregular schedule without setting an alarm.
                Integrated with your calendar, it triggers with
                your first day event with the spotify music of your choice, selected through the
                user interface built in a telegram bot.
                The user must have spotify premium and it also works as a music box
                and a spotify connected speaker. Furthermore it can reproduce youtube videos as music.
                <br /><br />
                I made this because I was tired of useless alarm clocks with radio that did not adapt
                completely to my needs. I have an irregular schedule so I can't set the same alarms every day, neither
                week, but I have a calendar with my events. Every night I checked the tomorrow's first event
                to set my alarm so that's exactly what I automatized with this project.
                The alarm clock is syncronized with the calendar and it sets the alarms
                automatically. I like to wake up with music, but not any music. I like to chose what music
                is better for me to wake up. Therefore I connected the alarm clock to spotify, where one can select
                the playlist, song or album to use for waking up. Moreover, I coded a
                growing ring volume with time so you wake up more naturally. Customization was the main motivation
                to do this project so this volume curve and limits
                are totally configurable by users without needing to know how to read the code as it's all in
                the telegram bot UI. Why telegram as user interface? <em>Keep it stupid simple</em>. The code and
                configuration instructions are

                Thesis project developed during my exchange experience in Amsterdam University of Applied
                Sciences. The programme follwed was the Design Build and Fly minor.
                <h4>Thesis Abstract</h4>
                Five students with different backgrounds have completed the Design, Build and Fly minor 
                in the Aviation Academy of the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences. The main goal of 
                this minor is to give the students a good practical approach in aircraft design and at the 
                end of it the students have been able to design, build and fly fixed wing, one engine 
                Unmanned Aerial Vehicle that is capable of flying a predetermined route and to drop a small 
                payload. This project includes the concept design, detail design, production plan and 
                evaluation of the project itself considering the flight results.
