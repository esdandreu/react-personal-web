This project was started with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Portfolio web app developed with React Redux, using a Fractal file architecture, baseline from the create-react-App repository. The development of this web took two weeks. The first week was dedicated to learning web development through two Udemy courses:

-[Develop your first web page (HTML5, CSS & responsive)](https://www.udemy.com/realiza-tu-primer-pagina-web-hmtl5-css-responsive/)

-[React JS Web Development - The Essentials Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/react-js-and-redux-mastering-web-apps/)

During the second week I developed the source code of this web page, which can be found in this repository.
